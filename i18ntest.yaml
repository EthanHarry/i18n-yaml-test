      embed: Degraded Performance Issue
      item1: Starting at approximately 3:00PM Pacific Time on Thursday Oct, 19th,
        the MyTime main database began experiencing degraded performance. This was
        caused by a potential bug in the MySQL 5.5 engine that we weren’t aware of
        and this made it difficult to quickly recover. Once the issue was identified,
        the MyTime engineering team rebooted the database to restore the functionality
        of the application. No data was lost but many customers were not able to access
        the web application or make updates to the mobile application during this
        time.
      item2: Overnight, we started the upgrade process to MySQL 5.6 and began re-architecting
        our system to prevent failures like this in the future. The MyTime team will
        continue working with internal and external resources to investigate and take
        additional measures to prevent such an incident from happening again. We know
        our software provides mission critical functionality to your business, and
        while we maintain a 99.9% uptime, no outage is ever acceptable. Our sincere
        apologies for any inconvenience this caused to you or your customers, and
        please know that our top priority is ensuring that your business runs seamlessly
        and reliably on the MyTime platform.

      jan16: On January 16, we'll be rolling out new pricing for MyTime Marketplace
        bookings
      mytime: MyTime Marketplace will continue to be a pay-for-performance source
        of appointment bookings with no upfront fees, no commitments, and no contracts.
      charge: We will charge a small commission on real bookings that come from through
        our Marketplace, as described below.
      note: 'Please note: This price change will NOT impact the cost of your MyTime
        Scheduler subscription in any way.'
      book: Bookings or purchases that come through the MyTime Marketplace will be
        charged a flat 10% commission (or a flat fee if the price varies). This commission
        applies to services, packages and gift cards regardless of whether it is a
        new or existing client.
      comiss: As before, there are NO commissions charged when customers book using
        the Book Now button on your website OR your custom MyTime URL (e.g., http://yourbusiness.mytime.com)
        that you can share with your customers.
      final: Finally, there are NO commissions charged on appointments you get through
        our exclusive direct booking integrations with Google and Facebook. However,
        you must have a MyTime Marketplace listing for these integrations to work.
      OK: OK, Got it!

      nobody_else: Nobody else can offer this kind of online benefit for your business
        except for MyTime. Why would you settle for less?
      online_scheduling: Online scheduling has become the industry standard in 2016.
        But did you know MyTime is the only cloud-based scheduling platform in the
        world that offers real-time messaging, photo sharing with clients, online
        listing and reputation management, and automated email and text message marketing?
        Greg Sterling, the top analyst for local business trends, describes MyTime
        as "a marketing and customer loyalty platform, using scheduling as the core
        piece of functionality." Forbes Magazine calls MyTime, "The Amazon of Local
        Services."
      what_could: What could MyTime do for your business? Our seamless client booking
        experience, available on web, mobile web, iPhone and Android makes it easy
        for your clients to book you 24/7 (and 40% of online bookings happen after
        business hours). Our exclusive online booking agreements with the leading
        search engines and social networks will make it possible for your clients
        to book you from more places. And our automated marketing system will reduce
        no-shows and keep existing clients coming back at greater frequency. The bottom
        line is that MyTime translates into more revenue and less work for you and
        your staff.
      please_take: Please take 10 minutes to get a live demo of what we can offer.
        You owe it to yourself, your employees and your customers such as
      to_at_least: to at least take a peek.
